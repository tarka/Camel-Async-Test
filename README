Camel Async Test
----------------

This small proof-of-concept app tests the asynchronous redelivery
feature of Camel 2.4+.  

To run:

   mvn jetty:run

What it does:

 * Starts embedded ActiveMQ broker, backed by a memory-only DB
 * Creates two Camel JMS queues: 'inputq' and 'expiredMessages' 
 * Expired messages routes to a simple logging bean
 * There is a quartz job that injects 16 messages, 1 second apart
 * 'inputq' is routed to a logging bean that throw errors a certain points:
 ** After 5 messages it throws a PermanentFailureException
 ** After 10 messages it throws a TemporaryFailureException
 * The error handler is configured as follows:
 ** PermanentFailureExceptions are immediately sent to the expired queue
 ** TemporaryFailureExceptions are retried with the following parameters:
 *** 3 retries
 *** 10 second delay between retries
 *** Asynchronous retries
